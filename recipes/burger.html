            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>

                <li>Half an onion lends texture and flavor. </li>
