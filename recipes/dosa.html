            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian breakfast of crispy crepes made with ground rice and lentil batter that is fermented. With just a handful of ingredients learn to make the classic Dosa recipe from scratch with my easy video and step-by-step photos. I also cover making your own dosa batter in a blender or mixer-grinder, tips on fermentation and cooking dosa to help you make the best dosa â€“ crispy, soft and so good to dunk in a bowl of Coconut Chutney or piping hot Sambar.
